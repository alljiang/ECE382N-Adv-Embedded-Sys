This directory contains code to test them Xilinx CDMA functionality
using the fork-join and interrupt contsructs that we teach in class.

There are 5 main files:

dma_interrupt.c
   This is the kernel module for the CDMA interrupts

dma_test.c
   This is the testing code

setup.sh
   This code sets up /dev
   
system_wrapper.bit
   This is a working.bit file that can be loaded using:
      cat system_wrapper.bit > /dev/xdevcfg
      
uImage-zynq-zed.dts
    This is the master DTS file that works with the system_wrapper.bit file
